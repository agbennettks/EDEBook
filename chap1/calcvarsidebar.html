<h4>THEOREM:</h4> <i>If a continuous function $G(x)$ has the property that 
$$\int_{a}^{c} G(x)h(x)dx =0$$
for all smooth functions $h(x)$ with $h(a)=0=h(c)$, then $G(x)\equiv 0$ 
for all $x$ in the interval $(a,c)$.</i>
<p />
<h4>SKETCH OF PROOF:</h4>

The idea here is that if there is a point $x_0$ where $G(x_0)\ne 0$, then 
there we can find a smooth function $h(x)$ such that 
$\int_{a}^{c} G(x)h(x)dx \ne 0$. Since we are given the integral is 0 for 
all choices of $h(x)$, it follows that we must have $G(x) = 0$ at all 
points.
<p />
So to start we assume we have a point $x_0$ with $G(x_0)\ne 0$. We suppose 
that $G(x_0)>0$ (the proof for the case where $G(x)<0$ is almost 
identical, just change the words positive and negative where needed). Now 
since $G(x)$ is continuous, there must be some little interval of 
$x_0$ where $G(x)>0$ for all points in the interval, say $(x_0-\delta, 
x_0+\delta)$ as pictured. Note that $G(x)$ might be positive for a ways 
outside the interval, or it might be negative or 0. We only need to know 
that $G(x)>0$ for every point in the interval.
<p />
Now we pick a "bump function" $h(x)$ which is identically 0 outside the 
interval 
$(x_0-\delta,x_0+\delta)$, but is positive for all the points in the 
interval, as pictured. Then we compute the integral of $G(x)h(x)$. Since 
$h(x)=0$ for all points outside the interval, $G(x)h(x)=0$ for all points 
outside the interval, so 
<img src=bumpfct.png width=422 height=248 align=right>
$$\int_{a}^{c} G(x)h(x)dx = 
\int_{x_0-\delta}^{x_0+\delta} G(x)h(x)dx $$	
(this is why we didn't care what $G(x)$ did outside the interval). On the 
other hand, we know both $G(x)>0$ and $h(x)>0$ for all points in the 
interval, so $G(x)h(x)>0$ for all points in the interval 
$(x_0-\delta,x_0+\delta)$. And if the function is everywhere positive, 
there is no chance of cancellation so the integral must also be positive, 
i.e.
$$\int_{x_0-\delta}^{x_0+\delta} G(x)h(x)dx > 0.$$
But this contradicts the given condition that the integral is always 0. 
So the only way to have the integral be 0 for all choices of $h(x)$ is to 
have $G(x)=0$ for all values of $x$ between $a$ and $c$.
