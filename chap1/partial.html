<h3>Partial Derivatives</h3>
</center>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
With separable equations we have already seen how it can be useful in solving differential equations to think 
of $x$ and $y$ as two variables, instead of thinking of $y$ just as a function of $x$. But once we start 
having two variables, we will occasionally run into situations where we need multivariable 
Calculus (Calculus 3). Fortunately, the concepts from Calculus 3 we need in Differential Equations are 
the most straightforward parts of Calculus 3, so you can pick them up quickly and there is no need to 
require a full semester of Calculus 3 before Differential Equations. 
The primary tool from Calculus 3 that we will use is partial derivatives.

<h4>Definition</h4> 
Let $f(x,y)$ be a function of $x$ and $y$. Then the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ 
is the derivative of $f$ treating $x$ as the only variable and $y$ as a constant. 
Similarly, the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$ is the derivative of $f$ treating $y$ 
as the only variable and $x$ as a constant. These derivatives are denoted 
$\partial f/\partial x$ and $\partial f/\partial y$. 
The definition extends in the obvious way to functions of more than two variables.

<h4>Examples</h4> 
EXAMPLE 1: Let $f(x,y)=x^2+3xy+y^3$. Then: 
$$\begin{align} 
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &= 2x+3y \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &= 3x + 3y^2
\end{align}
$$

EXAMPLE 2: Let $g(u,v,w)=\sin(uvw) + u^2 – 3vw$. Then:
$$\begin{align}
\frac{\partial g}{\partial u} &= vw\cos(uvw) + 2u \\
\frac{\partial g}{\partial v} &= uw\cos(uvw) – 3w \\
\frac{\partial g}{\partial w} &= uv\cos(uvw) – 3v
\end{align}$$

<h4>Mixed Partials</h4>
For higher derivatives, it appears you may now have a choice of the order in which you compute the 
partial derivatives if you take derivatives with respect to more than one variable. 
If you want the second partial derivative of $f$, where you differentiate once with respect to $x$ 
and once with respect to $y$, you could first compute the partial derivative with respect to $x$, 
and then take the partial derivative of that with respect to $y$, or you could reverse the order. 
The notation for this is 
$$\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right) \\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right) 
\end{align}$$

EXAMPLE 3: Let $f(x,y) = \exp(xy) + x^3 - 4xy + \sin(y)$. Then
$$\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(y\exp(xy) + 3x^2 – 4y\right) = \exp(xy) + xy\exp(xy) – 4 \\ 
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(x\exp(xy) – 4x + \cos(y(\right) = \exp(xy) + xy\exp(xy) – 4 
\end{align}$$
In this case, the two second derivatives with mixed partials turn out to be the same. In fact, that is the general case.

<h4>Key Theorems</h4>

THEOREM: If $\partial^2 f/\partial y\partial x$ and $\partial^2 f/\partial x\partial y$ are continuous, then they are equal.
<p />
Isn’t it just like mathematicians to worry about defining notation to distinguish between two quantities that turn out to be equal. O
f course, in mathematical theory, you can have situations where the mixed partials are not equal, but of course then they are 
not continuous. For the functions we will encounter in this class, that won’t be an issue. 
So in this class, mixed partials must always be equal. And this theorem has a converse.
<p />
THEOREM: If $\partial f/\partial y = \partial g/\partial x$ and these partial derivatives are continuous, then there is a function
of two variables, $F(x,y)$ such that $\partial F/\partial x = f$ and $\partial F/\partial y = g$.
<p />
So the only way for a partial with respect to $x$ to be equal to a partial with respect to $y$ is for them to be the mixed partials
for some function $F$. One other place that partial derivatives will be useful is in the chain rule for functions of several variables. 
<p />
THEOREM: Suppose $F(x,y(x))$ is a function of $x$ and $y$, where $y$ is a function of $x$. Then the derivative of $F$ with respect to $x$ is
$$
\frac{dF}{dx} = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dx}
$$
This extends in a straightforward way to functions of more than two variables. With these tools, you are ready 
for most of the applications of multivariable calculus that we will encounter in this class.
