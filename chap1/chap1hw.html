<li>Find a differential equation whose general solution is 
the set of curves, $e^{x}+e^{y}=C^2.$ Remember

<font size=-1>Technical note: Since a circle is not the graph of a 
function as it fails the vertical line test, it would be more proper to 
say the general solution consists of all semicircles of the form 
$y=\pm\sqrt{r^2-x^2}$. But the problem is easier to understand and to 
solve written as above.</font><p /> </li>

<li>Find $y(2)$ where $y(x)$ is the solution to the initial value problem
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dx}&=\frac{x-y}{x+2y} \\
y(0)&=1
\end{align}
$$
Note that solving this exact equation will lead to an implicit formula for 
$y$ which will have two solutions for $x=2$. However, the initial value 
problem has a unique solution and so just one of the two solutions 
produced from the implicit formula will be the actual value of $y(2).$ 
Justify your choice of value for $y(2).$ You can do this algebraically 
(say by solving the implicit formula to get an explicit formula for $y$ in 
terms of $x$ where the $\pm$ term will be specified to either be $+$ or 
$-$) or geometrically (perhaps by arguing from the slope field that the 
integral curve starting at (0,1) can only reach one of the two possible 
values because it can't go below the x-axis). Just saying you checked the 
slope field applet and can see 
which value must be right won't get full credit, you must justify how 
you can tell the integral curve can't go below the x-axis.<p /></li>
<li>Find $y(1)$ where $y(x)$ is the solution to the initial value problem
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dx}&=\frac{2x-2y}{2x+y} \\
y(0)&=\sqrt{3}
\end{align}
$$
Note that solving this exact equation will lead to an implicit formula for 
$y$ which will have two solutions for $x=1$. However, the initial value 
problem has a unique solution and so just one of the two solutions 
produced from the implicit formula will be the actual value of $y(1).$ 
Justify your choice of value for $y(1).$ You can do this algebraically 
(say by solving the implicit formula to get an explicit formula for $y$ in 
terms of $x$ where the $\pm$ term will be specified to either be $+$ or 
$-$) or geometrically (perhaps by arguing from the slope field that the

values because it can't go below the x-axis). Just saying you checked the

you can tell the integral curve can't go below the x-axis.<p /></li>

<li>Solve the initial value problem
$$ 
\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dx} &= 2xy+\sin(x) \\
y(0)&=1
\end{align}
$$
and then use your solution to evaluate $y(1).$
<i>Your answer should be accurate to the nearest 0.0001.</i>
Note that you will get an integral here that you can't compute 
analytically. You will need to use a numerical method to complete the 
problem (the TI-83/84 and 
similar calculators have an excellent numerical integration routine built 
in, or you can use 
<a href=http://www.wolframalpha.com>WolframAlpha</a>.)<p /></li>

<li>Solve the initial value problem
$$ 
\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dx} &= 1-\cos(x)y \\
y(0)&=2

<i>Your answer should be accurate to the nearest 0.0001.</i>
In this case you will get an implicit formula that you won't be able to 
solve analytically for $y$ in terms of $x$. You can substitute $2$ for $x$ 
in the solution to get an equation for $y$ which you can then solve 
numerically quickly using Newton's method (which you can find described in 
your calculus textbook or 
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method>online</a>). Since 
Newton's method has better convergence properties with a good 
starting value, you may want to approximate $y(2)$ using Euler's method or 
the improved Euler's method with a step-size of 1 or 2 to get your initial 
guess. Note that the work to finish the solution using Newton's method is 
much less than the work to get a numerical approximation to such a fine 
tolerance using the numerical methods like Euler's method to approximate the solution 
directly.<p /></li>

<li>Solve the initial value problem 
$$ 
\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dx}&=\frac{\sin(x)-\exp(x+y)+2xy}{3y^2-x^2+\exp(x+y)} \\
y(0)&=0

$$
and then use your solution to evaluate $y(1).$

In this case you will get an implicit formula that you won't be able to

<li>Find the general solution for $\exp(y)dx + (2x\exp(y)-1)dy = 0$. Hint: if 
you treat 
$x$ as a function of $y$, the equation is linear, i.e. it has an 
integrating factor that is a function of $y$ alone.<p /></li>

<li>Find the general solution for $-y\,dx + (x+x^2+y^2)dy = 0$. Hint:
$\displaystyle\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}$ is an integrating factor.

<li>Show that the equation $(x+4y)dx + (3x+6y)dy = 0$ has an integrating 
factor of the form $(x+y)^r$ for some value of $r.$ This will be 
true for any equation of the form $(ax+by)dx + ((a+c)x+(b+c)y)dy = 0,$ 
where the value of $r$ will depend on the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, but 
you don't have to justify the general case.
<p /></li>

<li>Suppose $w(x)$ solves the initial value problem
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dw}{dx} + p(x)w &= q(x) \\
w(0)&=0
\end{align}
$$
while $z(x)$ solves the initial value problem
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dz}{dx} + p(x)z &= 0 \\
z(0)&=y_0
\end{align}
$$
Show that $y(x)=w(x)+z(x)$ solves the initial value problem
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y &= q(x) \\
y(0)&=y_0
\end{align}
$$
The ability to cut a problem into pieces, solve each piece separately, and 
add up the answers to each piece to find an answer to the overall problem 
is a fundamental feature of "linear" equations in mathematics. We will 
discuss this more in chapter 2.
<p /> </li>

<li>
Suppose you are modeling a situation governed by the equation
$$\frac{dx}{dt}+ax=f(t),\qquad x(0)=x_0$$ with $a>0$, 
but due to measurement errors, your measured values $\tilde{f}(t)$ differ from the true 
values $f(t)$. Let $\tilde{x}(t)$ be the solution to the equation based on the imperfect data
$$\frac{d\tilde{x}}{dt}+a\tilde{x}(t)=\tilde{f}(t),\qquad \tilde{x}(0)=x_0.$$
Show that the difference between the true solution and the imperfect solution, $w(t)=x(t)-\tilde{x}(t)$,
is the solution to the initial value problem
$$\frac{dw}{dt}+aw=f(t)-\tilde{f}(t),\qquad w(0)=0.$$
<p /></li>

<li>
Show that in the previous problem, if the error in your measurement is bounded by $b$, i.e.
$|f(t)-\tilde{f}(t)|\le b$ for all $x>0$, then the error in your solution will be bounded by
$b/a$, i.e. $|x(t)-\tilde{x}(t)|\le b/a$ for all $x>0$. <br />
<i>Hint:</i> In the previous problem you showed $x(t)-\tilde{x}(t)$ satisfied a linear initial value problem,
so you can write the formula for the solution of a linear differential equation which will give you an
integral equal to $x(t)-\tilde{x}(t)$. 
Then use the fact that $|\int(g(t)\,dt|\le \int|g(t)|\,dt$ and the bound on $|f(t)-\tilde{f}(t)|$ to get the required
bound on the error in $\tilde{x}(t)$.

In problems 53 and 54, 
list the technique you would use to solve the 
following problem, separable, exact, linear, Bernoulli, homogeneous, or 
none of the above. Note 
that you will lose a point for choosing homogeneous for an equation that 
can be solved using the exact paradigm, even if homogeneous would work 
(exact is so much easier and you are much less likely to make a mistake).
You don't need to solve the equations, just list the technique you 
would use.

In the Change of Variables section we went over two types of equations 
that can be solved by making substitutions, Bernoulli equations and 
homogeneous equations. There are a lot of other substitutions that apply 
to other types of equations. The keys for all the different substitution 
methods are to rewrite the original variable $y$ in terms of the new 
variable $v$ and to be sure to make the substitution everywhere in the 
equation, including making the substitution in the derivative term, which 
may require use of derivative rules such as the chain rule (as in 
Bernoulli equations) or the product rule (as in homogeneous equations). 
Two other common types of equations that can be solved by substitutions are
<ul>
<li>Any equation of the form $\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}=f(\alpha x+\beta 
y+\gamma)$, where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are constants, can be 
transformed to a separable equation via the substitution $v=\alpha x + 
\beta y +\gamma$.<p /></li>
<li>Equations of the form $\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}=A(x)y^2+B(x)y+C(x)$ 
are called Riccati equations. If you know any one particular solution, 
$y_1(x)$, to a Riccati equation, you can find the general solution by 
transforming the Riccati equation to a linear equation with the 
substitution $v=\displaystyle\frac{1}{y-y_1(x)}$.</li>
</ul>
<p />
Using these tricks you can solve problems 59-64 below. Of course, to solve 
a Riccati equation you must first find one particular solution, but you can 
find one by guess and check more often than you might imagine. In context, 
you may know one obvious solution, or you might look at the slope field 
and be able to spot one simple solution like $y=1$ or $y=x$ or 
$y=\exp(x)$ (especially if the problem appears in an undergraduate math 
class).

equilibrium solutions to 
<p />

<li>
Suppose $\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}=x^2-y^2$, $y(1)=0.$ Explain how we can 
tell that $0 &lt; y(x) &lt; x$ for all $x &gt; 1$. Hint: sketch the slope 
field, specifically noting how the slope field looks along the lines $y = 
x$ and $y = 0$. Explain why an integral curve 
can't leave the wedge in the first quadrant formed by these two lines.
<p /></li>
<li>Two students are asked if the solution to the initial value problem
$\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=3x^2y^2$, $y(0)=1$ can ever take a negative 
value for $x > 0.$ Kasey argues that $y$ can't be negative because 
$3x^2y^2 > 0,$ so the derivative is
always non-negative, hence $y$ is always increasing or flat, and, since we
increase from $y = 1,$ $y$ must always be positive. On the other hand, 
Riley solves the problem to get 
$\displaystyle y = \frac{1}{1-x^3}$ and computes 
$\displaystyle y(2) = \frac{1}{1-2^3} = -\frac17 < 0$
hence y can be negative. Write a paragraph explaining whether Kasey or
Riley (or both or neither) is correct.

Suppose a fish population experiences logistic growth with growth rate $r$ 
per 
year and environmental carrying capacity $C$. The population is harvested 
at a rate of $h$ per year ($h$ might be a constant or it might be 
variable depending on the population). This situation is described by the 
differential equations
$$
\frac{dp}{dt}=rp(1-p/C)-h
$$
where $p$ is the population and $t$ is time (in years).
It is desired to harvest the 
fish to reach the maximum sustainable yield. That is, if you harvest too 
few fish, then you aren't getting all the fish you could. But if you 
harvest too many fish, you will drive the population too low (perhaps to 
extinction) and so your harvest won't be sustainable. The next 4 problems 
take you through the calculations of the maximum sustainable yield for two 
simple harvesting models.
<p />
<hr />
<p />
<li>Suppose the growth rate is $r=0.2$ (20%), the carrying capacity is 
$C=25,000,$ and the harvest is a constant $H$ fish per year. 
<ol type='a'>
<li>What are the equilibria for this model? Are they stable or 
unstable?</li>
<li>What is the maximum value of $H$ so that the model has an equilibrium 
with $p > 0$?</li>
</ol>
Hint: as always when determining equilibria, drawing a graph of $dp/dt$ 
vs. $p$ may be helpful.
<p /></li>
<li>Suppose the harvest is a constant $H$ fish per year. What is the 
maximum value of $H$ so that the model has an equilibrium with $p > 0$? 
Your answer this time will have $H$ as a function of $r$ and $C$, in 
contrast to the previous problem where you were given specific values for 
$r$ and $C.$<p /></li>
<li>Suppose the harvest is not a constant but is a fixed proportion of the 
total population, so $h=Ep$ where $E$ is the proportion of the population 
that is harvested. 
<ol type='a'>
<li>What are the equilibria for the model now?</li> 
<li>Which equilibrium is stable and which is unstable?</li>
</ol>
Note that the equilibrium populations will depend on the value of $E$, so 
your answers will be functions $E$ as well as $r$ and $C$
<p /></li>
<li>Assuming you end up at the stable equilibrium in problem 71, what 
proportion $E$ maximizes the harvest (recall $h=Ep$ where $p$ is now a 
function of $E$, $r$, and $C$)? What is the maximum sustainable 
yield $h$ for this approach?<p /></li>
<p />
<hr />
<p />
Many policies were originally designed to aim for the maximum 
sustainable yield as computed above. However, this 
model is quite simple and the 
target values developed using it sometimes turned out to be too high in practice.

<li>Find the general solution to $x(y')^2-yy' + 1=0$. You don't need to find the singular solution. 
(Hint: If you solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ and $y'$, this is a Clairaut equation).
<p /></li>
<li>Find the general solution to $(2x+1)(y')^2 - 2(y+2)y' + 4 = 0$. You don't need to find the singular solution.
(Hint: If you solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ and $y'$, this is a Clairaut equation).

<p /></li>
<li>Find a Clairaut differential equation whose general solution is all the tangent lines to $y=e^x$.
<p /></li>
<li>In the section on "Theory of First-order Equations", the Clairaut equation $y = xy' - (y')^2/4$
was solved, and it was pointed out that you could stitch different solutions together to get
new solutions. Consider the function 
$$h(x)=\begin{cases}
-2x-1 \text{ for }x<0, \\
2x-1\qquad\text{ for }x\ge 0.
\end{cases}$$
Is this a solution to $y=xy'-(y')^2/4$? Explain why or why not.
<p /></li>
<li>Find a solution to the Clairaut equation $y=xy' - (y')^2/4$ which passes through the points $(-2,5)$ and $(3,7)$. Hint:
You will have to stitch several basic solutions together.
<p /></li>
<li>An <i>envelope</i> of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point and these
points of tangency form the whole enveloping curve (note that most families of curves do <i>not</i> have an enveloping curve). 
Suppose a family of curves all solve a first-order differential equation, $F(x,y,y')=0$. Show that if the family of curves
has an enveloping curve, then that envelope also solves the differential equation.

<li>Consider the initial value problem $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=2x(y^2+1)$, $y(0)=0$. The true solution
is $y(x)=\tan(x^2)$, but here we will see how Picard iteration works for this problem. The iteration 
will start with $y_0(x)=0$. Compute
