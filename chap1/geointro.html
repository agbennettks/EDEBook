<h3>Geometric interpretation of a differential equation (Slope Fields)</h3>
</center>
<p />
<a href='lab1.html' target='_blank'>Launch Slope Field App</a>.

<table><tr>
<td>Consider a differential equation $\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y)$. 
Since the derivative is the slope of 
the tangent line, we interpret this equation geometrically to mean that at 
any point $(x,y)$ in the plane, the tangent line must have slope 
$f(x,y).$ We 
illustrate this with a slope field, a graph where we draw an arrow 
indicating the slope at a grid of points. The slope field for 
$\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}=x+y+2$ is illustrated at the right.</td>

<td>The solution to a differential equation is a curve that is tangent to the 
arrows of the slope field. Since differential equations are solved by 
integrating, we call such a curve an integral curve. 
This picture 
illustrates some of the integral curves for $\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}=x+y+2$. You 
can see there are a lot of possible integral curves, infinitely many in 
fact. This corresponds to the fact that there are infinitely many 
solutions to a typical differential equation. To specify a particular 
integral curve, you must specify a point on the curve. Once you specify 
one specific point, the rest of the curve is determined by following the 
arrows. This corresponds to finding a particular solution by specifying an 
initial value.</td>

<p />
In this lab, you will experiment with the slope fields and integral 
curves 
for a variety of different equations. The goal is to get a geometric 
concept of what a differential equation means, to go along with the 
algebraic techniques to solve such equations. Launch the 
<a href='lab1.html' target='_blank'>slope field app</a>. 
This brings up an app where you can type in differential equations and see 
their slope 
fields and integral curves. When you type in the differential equation, 
use ^ for powers, and functions (such as 
sin(x), exp(x), log(x), etc.) must use parentheses. Once you type in a 
formula, you should press enter or click the <nobr>"Update Slope 
Field"</nobr> button to 
draw the slope 
field. The 
<nobr>"Draw 33 Int. Curves"</nobr> button will draw the integral curves 
passing through the points 
<nobr>(-4, -4),</nobr> <nobr>(-4, -3.75),</nobr> <nobr>(-4, -3.5),</nobr> 
<nobr>...,</nobr> <nobr>(-4, 4)</nobr>. You 
can also draw a single integral curve passing through the point 
$(-4, y_0)$ 
by entering the value $y_0$ in the <nobr><code>"y(-4) ="</code></nobr> 
text field and pressing the 
<nobr>"Plot Integral Curve"</nobr> button next to it. Note that the 
<nobr>"Update Slope Field"</nobr> 
button clears old results from the screen, so if the screen gets too 
confusing, press <nobr>"Update Slope Field"</nobr> to clear it up. There 
is a red arrow that you can click and drag around the slope field to see 
what the slope is at different points. You may want to try seeing if you 
can visualize an integral curve by starting at an initial value at the 
left of the app and moving the point always in the direction of the arrow.
Or you may want to have the app draw an integral curve and trace along the 
curve with the arrow to see how the integral curve is always tangent to 
the arrow. 
<p />
<i>Write up your answers to the following 8 questions neatly on a separate 
sheet of paper. Be sure to use complete sentences in your answers to 
problems 3-6.</i>
<p />
The first pair of problems just ask you to play around with a couple of 
slope fields and initial conditions to get started and to make sure you 
understand the connection between the initial condition $y(-4) = y_0$ and 
the geometric picture of the integral curve.
<ol>
<li>Let $y'=\cos(x)+\sin(y)$. Find a value for <nobr>y(-4)</nobr> so that 
<nobr>-1 &lt; y(5) &lt; 1</nobr>.
<p /></li>
<li>Let $y'=y-x/2$. Find a value for <nobr>y(-4)</nobr> so 
that 
<nobr>-3 &lt; y(5) &lt; 0</nobr>.
<p />
The next problem illustrates that the solution to a differential equation 
may not be defined over the whole real line, but may only exist in some 
particular interval.<p /></li>
<li>Let $y'=-(x+2)/y$. Draw 33 integral curves. Note that none of the 
curves drawn extend entirely across the graph. You may have observed 
earlier that if you point at one of the integral curves with the mouse, 
that curve turns purple (and if you have multiple integral curves that get 
asymptotically close, the mouse is pointing at all of them and they all 
turn purple, which can lead to some pretty effects). Point at one of the 
integral curves. Note that only half the circle turns purple. Write a two 
or three sentence explanation for (i) why the solutions don't continue all 
the way across the graph and (ii) why the integral curve isn't the full 
circle.
<p />
A theorem we will discuss later says that for a "reasonable" initial value 
problem, there will be one and only one solution, which will be defined on 
some interval about the initial point. That there is a solution should 
seem reasonable at this point, just start at the initial value and follow 
the slope field and you will get the graph of the solution. The last 
example should illustrate why you might get a solution defined only in an 
interval.
<p /></li>
<li>In solving the first two problems, you almost certainly observed 
and used (if only implicitly) the fact that solution curves didn't cross 
to narrow the range of possible initial values to try. Explain how this 
fact implies that a "reasonable" initial value problem can't have two 
solutions.
<p />
In the final 4 problems, you will develop some feeling for the connections 
between the slope field and certain types of differential equations. First 
you will consider some examples, and then you can use the ideas you've 
developed to try to recognize a couple of equations by their slope fields.
<p /></li>
<li>Look at several examples of slope fields of the form $y'=f(x)$ where 
the right-hand-side doesn't depend on y. Press the <nobr>"Draw 33 
Int. Curves"</nobr> button to 
look at the integral curves for these slope fields. You should observe a 
pattern in such fields. Write one or two sentences to describe how you can 
tell if a slope field corresponds to such an equation.
<p /></li>
<li>Look at several examples of slope fields of the form $y'=f(y)$ where 
the right-hand-side doesn't depend on x (such equations are called 
"autonomous"). You should observe a pattern in such fields. Press the 
<nobr>"Draw 33 Int. Curves"</nobr> button to look at the integral curves 
for 
these slope 
fields. Do the integral curves have the same sort of pattern as for the 
fields considered in problem 5? Write one or two sentences to describe how 
you can tell if a slope field corresponds to such an equation.
