<h3>Autonomous Equations Lab</h3>

<a href=lab3.html target=_blank>Launch Autonomous 
Equations Lab</a>
<br /><i>Note that the system may be slow (latency of <10 seconds) for 
drawing 33 integral curves for some problems. Unfortunately, I haven't 
found a way yet
to get it to post a "Working" message to let you know it is 
thinking.</i><p /> 
<h4>Overview</h4>
Autonomous equations are equations of the form
$$\frac{dx}{dt}=f(x)$$
where the derivative does not depend on the independent variable, $t$ in 
this case. Here $x$ is the dependent variable, because it is a function 
of the independent variable, $t$. Of course, the names of the variables 
are unimportant. Equations like 
$$\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dx}&=y^2-1 \\
\frac{dx}{dt}&=\frac{k}{x^2} \\
\frac{dp}{dq}&=.07p(1-p/10000)
\end{align}
$$
are all autonomous, since the derivative depends only on the dependent 
variable (the function) and not the independent variable. Autonomous 
equations are common in practice since the laws of nature are not 
time-dependent. If we start from $F=mx''$ to create a differential 
equation, we have position $x$ as the dependent variable and time $t$ as 
the independent variable. In mechanics problems the force will usually 
depend on the position of where the particle is, the $x$, but not when it 
is there, the $t$. So the equations we develop this way will usually be 
autonomous.
<p />
Any autonomous equation is naturally separable, so you can find a general
solution by integration. But integration can be tricky, and frequently you
can use geometric techniques to find answers to practical questions more
easily than you can by writing down solutions. In problem 6 of the first
lab, you found rules for recognizing when a slope field was autonomous
(which in that context we defined as "a function of $y$ alone).  We will
now build on that geometric understanding to see how you can find certain
properties of solutions to autonomous equations, especially behavior as
the independent variable tends to $\pm\infty$, from geometric principles
without solving the equation. Next week we will use this understanding to
optimize harvesting strategies for a renewable resource (e.g. fish).

<h4>Graphing Autonomous Equations</h4>
The following link to <a href=lab3.html target=_blank>Launch Autonomous Equations Lab</a>
will bring up a new window where you can enter an autonomous differential equation
of the form
$$ \frac{dx}{dt}=f(x),\qquad x(0)=x_0 $$ 
and see how it looks in two versions. On the left it will show the graph of
$dx/dt$ versus $x$, i.e. the graph of $f(x)$. On the right, it will show the
slope field of the differential equation, which is a graph of $x$ vs. $t$. Note
that the $x$-axis is therefore horizontal on the left graph and vertical on the
right graph. The $x$-axis is marked in green on both axes, and there is a red dot
corresponding to the same value of $x$ on both graphs. The dot can be moved on the
right graph and the corresponding dot on the left graph will follow. The right graph
has buttons to plot either the one integral curve corresponding to the listed 
initial value or to plot 33 integral curves, just as in the slope field lab.
Also note that if you change the equation, you need to click the "Update Graphs"
button in the lower right to be sure everything updates.

<h4>Identifying Equilibria</h4>
<ol>
<li>Consider the following equations
<ul>
<li><code><nobr>x' = (x-3)*(x+1)</nobr></code></li>
<li><code><nobr>x' = x^2 - 4</nobr></code></li>
<li><code><nobr>x' = x^2 + 1</nobr></code></li>
</ul>
<b>List where x' is positive, negative and 0. List where the slope field for 
the differential equation is increasing, decreasing, and 
horizontal.</b> <p /></li>
<li><b>Conjecture a relationship between the 
<code><nobr>dx/dt vs. x</nobr></code> curve and the slope field for 
<code><nobr>x vs. t</nobr></code> based on your results from the first 
step.</b><p />
Note that this conjecture need not be correct. It will be judged on whether it is a plausible first guess
(though of course it is fine if it is correct). <p /></li>
<li>Repeat the first step for three more equations of your own choice to 
test the hypothesis you just created. <b>List your three new equations and the same information as you 
collected in Exercise 1.</b><p /></li>
<li>If the results with the next three equations confirmed your 
hypothesis, wonderful. If not, revise your hypothesis in light of the 
additional evidence and try again. Repeat until you are satisfied.
<b>List your final hypothesis.</b><p />
This time you will be graded on having a correct conclusion.<p />
</li>
<li><b>Write a paragraph explaining why your final hypothesis is correct.</b>
This explanation should involve the geometric interpretation of slope and derivative.
It is not acceptable just to say the hypothesis works for all the examples.
<i>Note that the paragraph should be written in complete sentences using proper
grammar and spelling.</i><p /></li>
</ol>
<h4>Classifying Equilibria</h4>
For an autonomous equation, a solution with a 
constant value of the form <code><nobr>x(t) = x<sub>0</sub></nobr></code> 
is called an equilibrium solution. An equilibrium solution is 
<i>stable</i> if nearby solutions converge to the equilibrium solution 
and unstable if nearby solutions move away from the equilibrium 
solution. For instance, if you draw the 33 integral curves in the first 
example (<code><nobr>x' = (x-3)*(x+1)</nobr></code>), you should see that 
<code><nobr>x = -1</nobr></code> is a stable equilibrium while 
<code><nobr>x = 3</nobr></code> is an unstable equilibrium. 
<ol start=6>
<li><b>Look through the examples you have created and identify the stable and unstable 
equilibria.</b><p /></li>
<li><b>Create a hypothesis to predict what the stable and unstable equilibria 
will be for an autonomous differential equation based on the 
<code><nobr>dx/dt vs. x</nobr></code> graph.</b><p />
As before, your initial hypothesis doesn't have to be right (though I think you can
probably get it right already).
<p /></li>
<li>As before, test three more equations of your own choice to test 
the hypothesis you just created. <b>List your three new equations and whether your
hypothesis correctly predicts the stable and unstable equilibria.</b>
<p/></li>
<li>If the results with the next three equations confirmed your 
hypothesis, wonderful. If not, revise your hypothesis in light of the 
additional evidence and try again. Repeat until you are satisfied.
<b>List your final hypothesis.</b><p /></li>
<li>As in exercise 5, <b>write a paragraph explaining why your final hypothesis is correct.</b>
This explanation should involve the geometric interpretation of slope and derivative. It is not
acceptable just to say the hypothesis works for all the examples. 
<i>Note that the paragraph should be written in complete sentences using proper grammar and spelling.</i>
<p /></li>
</ol>
<p />
While you may work with a partner on the lab (indeed, due 
to space constraints you will pretty much have to work together) everyone 
should turn in a separate lab report.
