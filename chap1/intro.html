<h4>
"Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe." - 
Galileo</h4>
Mathematics is the unique language that is precise enough to describe the 
world for science and engineering. In this class, we will start putting 
together what you have learned in calculus to use mathematics to describe 
population growth, spring-mass systems, electrical circuits, and a variety 
of other situations. 
<p />
Differential equations are one of the most important tools in writing such 
descriptions. A differential equation is just an equation involving one or 
more derivatives.
Differential equations are important because they let 
you write a description of a situation in terms of the forces acting in 
the situation. 
Consider Newton's second law of motion
$$\text{Force}=\frac{dp}{dt}$$
where $p$ is momentum and $t$ is time.
This is probably more familiar to you as $F=ma$, making the
assumption that mass is constant. Suppose you are told the acceleration of
gravity on the moon is $1.6 \text{m}/\text{sec}^2$ . If you drop a mass above
the surface of the
moon, how far will it fall in 1 second? Here you know acceleration, but what
you want to know is distance. This leads to the initial
value problem find $x(1)$ where $d^2x/dt^2 =  -1.6$, $x(0) = 0$, 
$x'(0)=0$. 
In a physical situation you often know the forces acting on an object and then
have to determine the future behavior of the object. This will lead to a
differential equation. 
Of course differential equations occur in many 
other subjects besides physics. The idea of thinking of a situation in 
terms of the "forces" acting on it makes sense not just in physics but in 
economics, population biology, and many other disciplines. We will meet 
a variety of applications for differential equations during this course.
<p />

<p />
While the example above leads to a specific equation that we need to 
solve, there are many situations where the key is being able to interpret 
the consequences of a differential equation without actually finding a 
solution. For example, Newton's third law says that for every action 
(force) there is an equal and opposite reaction. This says the total net 
force in every situation is 0 (though there may be non-zero forces acting 
on any particular object in the situation). Now since 
$\text{Force}=\displaystyle\frac{dp}{dt}$, this says 
$\displaystyle\frac{dp}{dt}=0$, i.e. total momentum has a 0 derivative, so 
momentum is conserved. Here we have deduced a key physical law by 
interpreting what the differential equation is saying, rather than solving 
a specific problem. In this class you will be asked both to solve problems 
and also to use and interpret differential equations to describe and 
explain mathematical and scientific ideas. 
<p />

<p />
Mathematical language can be approached in several different ways. You can 
look at problems both algebraically and graphically. This class will push 
you to translate between these different approaches so you can better 
understand what each tells you and be better prepared to handle real 
problems where you may need to switch back and forth between different 
representations. Also note that like any language, mathematics in general
and differential equations in particular has grammar and spelling to be mastered,
which in this class means algorithms for solving various types of equations.
While computers are getting better at solving specific equations, a facility with
the solution techniques will be helpful in understanding differential equations.
So this class will feature both online homework problems to build that facility
as well as written problems that will (hopefully) build understanding of what
a differential equation means.
<p />

<p />
In the rest of this section, we will introduce some definitions and 
notation, concentrating on the algebraic viewpoint. We will discuss the 
geometric viewpoint starting in the section on Slope Fields, which will be 
covered in the lab.
<p />
<h4>Definitions</h4>
A <b>differential equation</b> is an equation involving derivatives.
<p />
EXAMPLES:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dZ}{dt}&=175-\frac{2}{100+3t}Z \tag{a} \\
x^2\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+x\frac{dy}{dx}+(x^2-1)y&=0 \tag{b}\\
\frac{dp}{dt}&=-.01p^2+p \tag{c}\\
I''+2I'+10Ix&=V_0\omega\sin(\omega t) \tag{d}\\
\exp(f(x))\sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}  &=
\frac{\exp(f(x))\left((f'(x))^2+f''(x)\right)
      (1+(f'(x))^2) -
      \exp(f(x))(f'(x))^2f''(x)}
     {\left(1+(f'(x))^2\right)^{3/2}} \tag{e}
\end{align}
$$

In equation (a) for example, $Z$ is to be a function of $t$ whose derivative is
175 minus $2/(100+3t)$ times the original function $Z$. Note that we write $Z$ instead
of $Z(t)$. We will usually not distinguish between functions and variables in
our notation. It will actually make things easier in some problems to just
think of functions as variables and treat them accordingly. Of course, in 
some situations you may want to use the $f'$ notation rather than $df/dx$ 
and the names of the variables can be whatever is convenient. The key is 
having an equation involving derivatives, not what notation is used. You may have
noted that while we are talking about equations using derivatives, the subject is
called differential equations, not derivative equations. We will discuss the reason
for this in the section on Separable Equations.
<p />

<p /> Note that the above
examples are all "real" examples that arise in applications. Equation (a) represents
a particular mixing problem. Equation (b) is Bessel's equation of order 1, which 
arises in problems with cylindrical symmetry, such as the vibration of a drum head.
Equation (c) is an example of a logistic equation, which is used in modeling population
dynamics. Equation (d) gives the current flowing through a particular AC
circuit. Equation (e) is an example of an Euler-Lagrange equation from a particular
problem in the Calculus of Variations. Depending on how fast class runs, we may 
or may not get to Bessel equations, but we will solve the other equations in this class
(even that monstrous looking equation (e), which is actually nicer than it looks). And
this being a math class, we will also look at some equations that are chosen
for their intrinsic beauty and not just for applications.
<p />
 
<p />
The <b>order</b> of a differential equation is the highest order of 
derivative that
occurs in the equation. In the examples above, (a) and (c) are first order while the
other examples are second order. A <b>particular solution</b> to a 
differential
equation is a function that satisfies the equation.
<p />
EXAMPLES:
$$
\begin{align}
y(x) = x^2 &\text{ is a particular solution to } \frac{dy}{dx}=2x \\
y(x)=x^2+1 &\text{ is a particular solution to } \frac{dy}{dx}=2x
\end{align}
$$

This illustrates a problem with differential equations, solutions are usually
not unique (a problem has a "unique" solution if it has only one 
solution).
There are two common
approaches to resolving this difficulty.
One is to ask for the general solution instead of
the particular solution. A
<b>general solution</b> is a set of solutions to a differential equation 
with
as many arbitrary constants as the order of the equation.
<p />
EXAMPLE:
$$
y(x)=x^2+C \text{ is the general solution to } \frac{dy}{dx}=2x
$$
For any choice of the arbitrary constant $C$ we get a solution to the equation.
The two solutions in the previous example come from choosing $C=0$ and $C=1$.
The equation is first order so we only expect one arbitrary constant.
In many cases the general solution gives all the solutions but this need not
be the case. A <b>singular solution</b> is a particular solution to an
equation which is not an instance of the general solution. We will see
examples of this later. (The term singular solution is sometimes given a 
more restrictive and technical meaning in advanced courses.)
<p />
A second approach to dealing with the non-uniqueness of solutions is to narrow
the problem.  We ask not for any old solution to the problem but rather for a
solution which also has some additional properties.  One common situation is
an <b>initial value problem</b> where one wants the solution to a 
differential
equation which takes a specified value at a given point.
<p />
EXAMPLE:
$$
\begin{align}
&y(x)=x^2+3 \text{ is the unique solution to the
initial value problem } \\
&\frac{dy}{dx}=2x \text{ and } y(1)=4
\end{align}
$$

A function which solves a differential equation can be given in two different
forms. An <b>explicit solution</b> is a function written in the usual form 
of a
formula applied to an independent variable.
<p />
EXAMPLES: The following functions are defined explicitly
$$
\begin{align}
y(x)&=x^2+\tan(x) \\
y(x)&=\sqrt{1-x^2} \\
y(x)&=-\sqrt{1-x^2}
\end{align}
$$

A second way to write the function is to give a relationship between the 
function and the independent variable. The implicit function theorem can 
then be used to show a function exists which satisfies the relationship, 
though it may be difficult or impossible to write the function 
explicitly (the implicit function theorem is usually covered in Advanced 
Calculus 2).
<p />
EXAMPLES:
$$
\begin{align}
y-x^2-\tan(x)&=0 \\
x^2+y^2&=1
\end{align}
$$

The first relation above generates the first function in the previous example,
while the second relation above generates both the second and the third
functions of the previous example. An <b>implicit solution</b> to a
differential equation is a relation which generates a function which solves
the equation. Note that it is possible to check if an implicit solution solves
a differential equation without actually computing the explicit solution by
using implicit differentiation to solve for $y'$.
While an explicit solution has obvious advantages over an
implicit solution, often it is easy to find an implicit solution while the
algebra involved in generating an explicit solution is difficult or
impossible. It is also possible that an implicit solution will be more
familiar and easier to understand (consider $x^2+y^2=1$ vs. $y=\pm\sqrt{1-x^2}$). In
these cases we will settle for an implicit solution.
