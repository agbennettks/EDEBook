<h3>Homogeneous Equations</h3>
</center>
<p />
<h4>Discussion</h4>
As the results in the first section showed, solving the homogeneous equation
plays a special role in solving the general problem. One way to solve such 
problems is to factor the equation. Consider the example
$$ y''-y=0$$
We factor the equation to a pair of first-order equations.
        Let $D=d/dx$. Then $D^2=DD=(d/dx)(d/dx)=d^2/dx^2$. Write the equation
$y''-y=0$ as
        $$ \begin{align}
        (D^2 - 1)y &= 0 \\
        (D-1)(D+1)y &= 0 \\
        (D-1)y = 0\qquad  &\text{OR}\qquad  (D+1)y = 0  \\
        y = Ce^x\qquad&\text{OR}\qquad    y = Ke^{-x} \\
        \text{General Solution:}\quad  y &= Ce^x  + Ke^{-x}
\end{align} $$
where we use the fact from the previous section that the sum of solutions to a linear
homogeneous equation is also a solution. We can then check this solution by
computing
$$ \eqalign
{y&=Ce^x+Ke^{-x} \cr
y'&=Ce^x-Ke^{-x} \cr
y''&=Ce^x+Ke^{-x} \cr} $$
and so $y''-y=0$ as desired.
So we have solved a linear constant coefficient homogeneous equation by
treating
it as a polynomial with a "variable" $D$. If the equation was not
constant
coefficient, the method would become much harder because we wouldn't be able
to factor in the same fashion we are used to. This is because the algebra of
differential operators is different from the usual algebra learned in high
school. For example
$$ \begin{align}
(D+x)(D+1)y &= y'' + (x+1)y' + xy \\
(D+1)(D+x)y &= y'' + (x+1)y' + (x+1)y.
\end{align} $$
So we see $(D+x)(D+1)$ is not equal to $(D+1)(D+x)$. In other words, the
commutative law fails for differential operators. Differential Algebra is a
very interesting subject but it quickly gets very difficult. That is why 
we restrict our attention here to the constant coefficient case.
For the constant coefficient case everything works the
same
as in high school algebra and let's be thankful for it. There are three points
to remember in solving these equations by factoring:
<p />
<ol>
<li>The solution to $(D-r)y = 0$  is  $y = Ce^{rx}$.<p /></li>
<li>The solution to $(D-r)^2 y = 0$  is  $y = Cxe^{rx}   + Ke^{rx}$.
<p /></li>
<li>The solution to $(D-r)^n y = 0$ is
$y=C_{n-1}x^{n-1}e^{rx}+C_{n-2}x^{n-2}e^{rx}+\cdots+C_0e^{rx}$.
<p /></li>
</ol>
In all three cases $r$ represents a constant. The first equation is both separable
and
linear and can be easily solved. The second equation is a little trickier. We
solve it by converting to a system.
Let $u=(D-r)y$. Then the equation is $(D-r)u=0$ and so $u=Ce^{rx}$. Now we
solve $Ce^{rx}=(D-r)y$ (which is a first-order linear equation) for $y$ to
obtain $y=Cxe^{rx}+Ke^{rx}$ as advertised. Repeating this process we get the
solution to the general case in the third equation.

<h4>Paradigm</h4> Find the general solution of $y''+3y'-10y=0$
<p />
<i>Step 1:</i> Write in operator form (with $D$ for $d/dx$)
$$(D^2+3D-10)y=0$$
<i>Step 2:</i> Factor and find roots.
<p />
$(D-2)(D+5)y=0$ so the roots are $2$, $-5$.
<p />
<i>Step 3:</i> Write the general solution.
$$y(x)=Ce^{2x}+Ke^{-5x}$$
<hr />
<i>EXAMPLE 1:</i>   $$y'' + 4y' + 3y = 0 \qquad y(0)=1,\quad y'(0)=1$$

FIRST: Find the general solution.
<p />
Step 1: $(D^2 + 4D + 3)y = 0 $
<p />
Step 2: $ (D+3)(D+1)y = 0 $ so the roots are $-3$, $-1$
<p />
Step 3: $ y = Ce^{-3x}   + Ke^{-x} $
<p />
SECOND: Plug in the initial
values and solve for the constants.
$$ \begin{align}
y(0) &= Ce^{-3\times0}     + Ke^{-1\times0}    =  C + K  
\buildrel{\text{set}}\over{=} 1 \\
y'(x) &= -3Ce^{-3x}   - Ke^{-x} \\
y'(0) &= -3Ce^{-3\times0}    - Ke^{-1\times0}   = -3C - K  
\buildrel{\text{set}}\over{=} 1 
\end{align} $$
Taking 3 times the first equation and adding it to the second we find $2K=4$ so
$K=2$ and $C=-1$. This gives us the solution
$$y=-e^{-3x}+2e^{-x}$$
<hr />

<i>EXAMPLE 2:</i> $$  y'' + 10y' + 25y = 0$$
Step 1: $(D^2 + 10D + 25)y = 0$
<p />
Step 2:$ (D+5)^2 y = 0$, double root of $-5$
<p />
Step 3:  $y = Cxe^{-5x}   + Ke^{-5x}$
<p />
<hr />
<p />
Now we consider the equation $y''+y=0$. If we try to solve this equation
using our new techniques, we obtain the operator $D^2+1$ which
has roots $\pm i$, so the general solution is $c_1e^{ix}+c_2e^{-ix}$.
This is in fact the correct general <i>complex</i> solution, provided
we allow $c_1$ and $c_2$ to be arbitrary complex constants.
But since
we started with a real problem we probably want a real answer. One
way to deal with that is to obtain the general complex solution as
above and find all the complex solutions which are actually real
solutions. The algebra involved in that is rather messy though.
Fortunately, there is a quicker way that will give us two linearly
independent real solutions from a single complex solution.
<p />
<i>Theorem:</i> If $e^{(\alpha+\beta i)x}$ is a solution of the equation
$ay''+by'+cy=0$ where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are all real, then
$e^{\alpha x}\cos(\beta x)$ and $e^{\alpha x}\sin(\beta x)$ are two
linearly independent solutions of $ay''+by'+cy=0$. 
<p />
<i>Proof:</i> We are given that
$$
a(e^{(\alpha+\beta i)x})''+
b(e^{(\alpha+\beta i)x})'+c(e^{(\alpha+\beta i)x})=0
$$
Since $\Re[y'(x)]=(\Re[y(x)])'$ and $\Im[y'(x)]=(\Im[y(x)])'$,
it follows that 
$$ \eqalign {
a(\Re[e^{(\alpha+\beta i)x}])''+
b(\Re[e^{\alpha+\beta i)x}])'+c(\Re[e^{(\alpha+\beta i)x}])&=0 \cr
a(\Im[e^{(\alpha+\beta i)x}])''+
b(\Im[e^{\alpha+\beta i)x}])'+c(\Im[e^{(\alpha+\beta i)x}])&=0 \cr}
$$
So $e^{\alpha x}\cos(\beta x)$ and $e^{\alpha x}\sin(\beta x)$ are
both real solutions to the given equation. Linear independence can be
quickly checked using the Wronskian. 
<p />
Using this theorem we can now handle complex roots efficiently. One point
that often bothers students at this stage is that we only need one
complex solution to find the complete general solution. What happens
to the other complex solution? It is a theorem that complex roots to a 
real polynomial always come in complex conjugate pairs, $\alpha\pm\beta 
i$. So since the operator has real
coefficients, if $\alpha+\beta i$ is one root of the polynomial
equation, $\alpha-\beta i$ must be another root of the equation, and
$\alpha-\beta i$ will give rise to the same pair of real roots. So we
really get our pair of real roots from a pair of complex roots. 
<p />
Another point to be noted is that we can write the pair of real solutions 
we get from our complex conjugate pair  of roots $\alpha\pm\beta i$ as 
either $C_1e^{\alpha x}\cos(\beta x) + C_2e^{\alpha x}\sin(\beta x)$ or as 
$Ae^{\alpha x}\cos(\beta x-\phi)$ (with arbitrary constants $A$ and 
$\phi$) using the techniques of section 3. The first form is usually the 
easiest for solving initial value problems while the second form is 
usually the easiest for sketching solutions. And, of course, in initial 
value problems where you have to sketch solutions, you may want to solve 
first in one form to solve the initial value problem and then switch to 
the second form to draw your sketch.

<i>EXAMPLE 3:</i> $$  y'' + 2y' + 2y = 0$$

Step 1: Write the equation in operator form
$$(D^2 + 2D + 2)y = 0$$
Step 2: Find the  roots of the equation
<p />
roots are $-1\pm i$
<p />
Step 3: The general solution is $Ae^{-x}\cos(x-\phi)$ (or 
$C_1e^{-x}\cos(x)+C_2e^{-x}\sin(x)$ in the alternate form).
<p />
<hr />
<p />
<i>EXAMPLE 4:</i> $$y''+y=0,\qquad y(0)=1,\quad y'(0)=1$$

FIRST: Find the general solution.
<p />
Step 1: $(D^2+1)y=0$
<p />
Step 2: roots are $\pm i$
<p />
Step 3: $y(x)=C\cos(x)+K\sin(x)$ (the easiest form for initial value 
problems).
<p />
SECOND: Plug in the initial values and solve for the constants
$$ \begin{align}
y(0)&=C
\buildrel{\text{set}}\over{=} 1 \\
y'(x)&=-C\sin(x)+K\cos(x) \\
y'(0)&=K \buildrel{\text{set}}\over{=} 1 
\end{align} $$
So the solution to the initial value problem is $y(x)=\cos(x)+\sin(x)$.

<p />
<hr />
<p />
<i>EXAMPLE 5:</i> $$y'''+y=0$$

Step 1: $(D^3+1)y=0$
<p />
Step 2: $D^3+1=(D+1)(D^2-D+1)$ so the roots are $-1$ and 
$1/2\pm(\sqrt{3}/2)i$.
<p />
Step 3: The solution corresponding to the root $-1$ is $e^{-x}$. The 
solutions corresponding to the complex conjugate pair $1/2\pm(\sqrt{3}/2)i$ 
are $Ae^{x/2}\cos(\sqrt{3}x/2-\phi)$. So the general solution is 
$$y(x)=C_1e^{-x}+Ae^{x/2}\cos(\sqrt{3}x/2-\phi).$$
<hr />
<p />
<i>EXAMPLE 6:</i> $$y''''+8y'''+27y''+38y'+26y=0$$

Step 1: $(D^4+8D^3+27D^2+38D+26)y=0$
<p />
Step 2: $D^4+8D^3+27D^2+38D+26=(D^2+2D+2)(D^2+6D+13)=0$ so the roots are 
$-1\pm i$ and $-3\pm 2i$.
<p />
Step 3: $y=Ae^{-x}\cos(x-\phi)+Be^{-3x}\cos(2x-\psi)$, or written in the 
alternate form $y=C_1e^{-x}\cos(x)+C_2e^{-x}\sin(x)+C_3e^{-3x}\cos(2x)+ 
C_4e^{-3x}\sin(2x)$.
<p />
<hr />
<p />
<i>EXAMPLE 7:</i> $$y''''+4y'''+24y''+40y'+100y=0$$

Step 1: $(D^4+4D^3+24D^2+40D+100)y=0$
<p />
Step 2: $(D^2+2D+10)^2=0$ so we have <i>double</i> roots of $-1\pm 3i$.
<p />
Step 3: We handled double real roots by using both the usual solution 
and the solution multiplied by $x$. We do exactly the same thing with 
double complex roots. So the solution is 
$y=Ae^{-x}\cos(3x-\phi)+Bxe^{-x}\cos(3x-\psi)$ or in the alternate form 
$y=C_1e^{-x}\cos(3x)+C_2e^{-x}\sin(3x)+C_3xe^{-x}\cos(3x)+C_4xe^{-x}\sin(3x)$.

<h4>Randomly Generated Examples</h4>
A randomly generated second order constant coefficient linear homogeneous initial value problem is below.
As always, once you submit an answer, you will have a link to see the detailed
solution for the problem, as well as the option to generate a new problem and you can just quickly enter 
a "dummy" answer like $x$ to quickly get to the detailed solution if that is all you want to see.
