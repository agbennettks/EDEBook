<h3>Math 340 Written Homework Chapter 2</h3>
</center>

<ol>

<li>Using Euler's formula, $\exp(ix)=\cos(x)+i\sin(x),$ 
and the usual rules of exponents, establish De 
Moivre's formula,
$$ \left(\cos(n\theta)+i\sin(n\theta)\right) = 
\left(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta)\right)^n. $$
</li>

<li>
Use DeMoivre's formula to write the following in terms of $\sin(\theta)$ 
and 
$\cos(\theta)$.
<ol type='a'>
<li>$\cos(6\theta)$</li>
<li>$\sin(6\theta)$</li>
</ol>
<p /></li>

<hr />
One of the properties of the $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ that I hope you 
recall from trigonometry is that $\cos(x)$ is an even function, i.e. 
$\cos(-x)=\cos(x),$ while $\sin(x)$ is an odd function, i.e. 
$\sin(-x)=-\sin(x).$ We will see that any function can be split into 
pieces with these symmetries.
<hr /><p />

<li>Given a general function $f(x),$ define $\displaystyle 
f_e(x)=\frac{f(x)+f(-x)}2$ and $\displaystyle f_o(x)=\frac{f(x)-f(-x)}2.$. 
Show <p /><ol type='a'>
<li>$f(x)=f_e(x)+f_o(x),$ and <p /></li>
<li>$f_e(x)$ is an even function and $f_o(x)$ is an odd function.</li>
</ol>
So every function can be split into even and odd pieces.<p /></li>

<li>Given that $f(x)=f_e(x)+f_o(x)$ where $f_e(x)$ is an even function and 
$f_o(x)$ is an odd function, show that <p /><ol type='a'>
<li>$\displaystyle f_e(x)=\frac{f(x)+f(-x)}2,$ and <p /></li>
<li>$\displaystyle f_o(x)=\frac{f(x)-f(-x)}2,$ and </li>
</ol>
This shows the decomposition in the previous problem is the unique way to 
cut a function into even and odd pieces.<p /></li>

<hr />
If we apply the decomposition developed in the previous two problems to 
the exponential function, we get the <i>hyperbolic functions</i>,
$$
\begin{align}
\cosh(x)&=\frac{\exp(x)+\exp(-x)}2 \\
\sinh(x)&=\frac{\exp(x)-\exp(-x)}2 
\end{align} $$
These functions are covered in your calculus text, but sometimes that 
section is skipped. They are closely related to the usual trigonometric 
functions and you can define hyperbolic tangent, secant, cosecant, and 
cotangent in the obvious way (e.g. $\displaystyle 
\tanh(x)=\frac{\sinh(x)}{\cosh(x)}$). The next 
few problems give a quick overview of some of their properties. 
<hr />
<p />
<li>Show <ol type='a'>
<li>$\cosh(ix)=\cos(x),$ and <p /></li>
<li>$\sinh(ix)=i\sin(x).$</li>
</ol>
So the hyperbolic functions are just rotations of the usual trigonometric 
functions in the complex plane.<p /></li>

<li>Verify the following hyperbolic trig identities.<p /><ol type='a'>
<li>$\cosh^2(x)-\sinh^2(x)=1$<p /></li>
<li>$\cosh(s+t)=\cosh(s)\cosh(t)+\sinh(s)\sinh(t)$<p /></li>
</ol>Note that these are almost the same as the corresponding identities 
for the regular trig functions, except for changes in the signs. You can 
derive hyperbolic identities corresponding to all the different identities 
you learned in trigonometry. <p /></li>

<li>Invert the formula $\displaystyle \sinh(x)=\frac{\exp(x)-\exp(-x)}2$ 
to write $\sinh^{-1}(x)$ in terms of $\log(x).$ Note that you will need to 
use the quadratic formula to get the inverse.<p /></li>

<li>Verify the following differentiation rules for the hyperbolic 
functions<p /><ol type='a'>
<li>$\displaystyle \frac{d\sinh(x)}{dx}=\cosh(x),$ and <p /></li>
<li>$\displaystyle \frac{d\cosh(x)}{dx}=\sinh(x).$ </li>
</ol>
So for the hyperbolic functions you don't have to try to remember which 
derivative gets a minus sign.<p /></li>

<li>Use the substitution $x=\sinh(u)$ to evaluate the integral
$$
\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}.
$$
This integral can also be evaluated with a trig substitution, but using a 
hyperbolic substitution simplifies the process. <p /></li>

The equation for a freely hanging chain (or wire or what-have-you) is
$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=\frac{\delta g}{H}\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2}
$$
where $y$ and $x$ are the vertical and horizontal coordinates of the 
chain, $\delta$ is the linear density of the chain, $g$ is the 
acceleration of gravity, and $H$ is the horizontal tension in the chain. 
The curve that solves this equation is called a <i>catenary</i>, after the 
Latin word for "chain." 
If you are curious about the derivation of this equation, you are welcome 
to come by my office and ask about it. This is a second-order non-linear 
equation. In general, we won't tackle such problems in this course, but 
this one has the special feature that $y$ never appears by itself. You 
only see its derivatives, $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}$ and 
$\displaystyle \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}.$ 
That allows us to use a special trick to reduce this 
to a first-order equation, which we can actually solve.

<!--
<li>Show that the operator 
$$
Ly=\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-\frac{\delta 
g}{H}\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2}
$$
is non-linear.<p /></li>
-->

<li>Suppose $\delta g/H=2$ so the equation for the catenary becomes
$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=2\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2}.
$$
Make the substitution $\displaystyle p=\frac{dy}{dx}.$
This leads to a separable equation in $p$ and $x.$ Solve 
this equation for $p(x)$ (the integral in problem 9 will be helpful). 
Then back-substitute and integrate 
$\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=p(x)$ to find the solution. Note that you 
will get one arbitrary constant from the separable equation and a second 
arbitrary constant from the integration in the back-substitution, giving 
you the two arbitrary constants you expect for a second-order equation.
<p /></li>

<hr>
As we move to higher-order equations we will stick primarily to linear 
equations. Non-linear equations are in general much harder to handle. 
However, we can use a trick to reduce the order of <i>autonomous</i> 
non-linear equations which will let us solve some second-order non-linear 
equations. If you have an equation of the form
$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=f\left(y,\frac{dy}{dx}\right)
$$
where the right-hand-side doesn't depend on $x$ (or whatever letter is the 
independent variable), you make the substitution 
$\displaystyle p=\frac{dy}{dx}.$ Then 
$\displaystyle \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=\frac{dp}{dx}$ 
so the original second order equation is now a first-order equation.
Unfortunately, instead 
of just having two variables, we now have $p$, $y$ and $x.$ But since the 
original equation was autonomous, the only place $x$ appears is in the 
derivative,
$$
\frac{dp}{dx}=f(y,p).
$$
So if we could write $\displaystyle \frac{dp}{dx}$ in terms of just $p$ 
and 
$y,$ we would have a first-order equation in just $p$ and $y$ and we could 
solve it using the techniques of the previous chapter. To do this, we use 
the chain rule, which says
$$
\frac{dp}{dx}=\frac{dp}{dy}\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dp}{dy}p
$$
So our equation now becomes
$$
\frac{dp}{dy}=\frac{f(y,p)}p
$$
which is a first-order equation. Once we solve it to find $p(y)$, we then 
back-substitute and solve the separable equation
$\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=p(y)$ to find the solution to the original 
equation. Note that we pick one arbitrary constant when we solve the 
first-order equation and a second arbitrary constant when we solve the 
separable equation during the back-substitution, so we end up with two 
arbitrary constants, just as we expect when given a second-order equation.

<hr />
Once you have factored a second order linear differential operator as
$Lu = RSu$, you can solve $Lu=f$ by first solving $Rv=f$ and then $Su=v$.
Using this, find the general
solutions to the following problems.

<li>Solve $(D-r)^2y=0$, justifying the claim made in point 2 of the 
<a href=homo.html>text section on homogeneous equations</a>.<p /></li>

<li>Assume the solution of $(D-r)^ny=0$ is 
$y=C_{n-1}x^{n-1}e^{rx} + 
C_{n-2}x^{n-2}e^{rx} + \cdots + C_0e^{rx}.$ Using this assumption, show 
that the solution of $(D-r)^{n+1}y=0$ is 
$y=C_{n}'x^{n}e^{rx} + 
C_{n-1}'x^{n-1}e^{rx} + \cdots + C_0'e^{rx}$ (where we use C_0' so we 
don't get confused about the two sets of arbitrary constants).<p /></li>
<hr>
We can use the result in the previous problem to
justify the claim made in point 3 of the 
<a href=homo.html>text section on homogeneous equations</a>.
Problems 32 and 33 
have shown the result is true for $n=1$ and $n=2$. We could also reason by problem 34 that
since the result is true for $n=1$, it is also true for $n=1+1=2$ But 
then since the result is true for $n=2,$ it must also be true for $n=3.$ 
And continuing, it must be true for all $n.$ This general process of 
proving something is true for a starting value, and then proving if it is 
true for one value, it will also be true for the next value, and 
concluding the statement is then always true is called <i>mathematical 
induction.</i>

Show that the answer you get is a <b>real</b> function, illustrating that 
a linear differential equation with real coefficients and real initial 
data will have a real solution.<p /></li>

<li>Consider the differential operator
$$Ly=\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-2y\frac{dy}{dx}.$$
<ol type='a'>
<li>Show two homogeneous solutions of $Ly=0$ are $y_1=\tan(x)$ and 
$y_2=-\tanh(x).$</li>
<li>In general, $y=c_1y_1(x)+c_2y_2(x)$ is <b>not</b> a solution to the 
equation $Ly=0$ for this operator.
Why can't we just take linear combinations here like we did in 
the <a href=homo.html>text section on homogeneous equations</a>?</li></ol>
<p /></li>

<li>When solving a polynomial equation in algebra, once you find one 
solution you can factor it out to get an equation of smaller degree. We 
can do something similar with linear differential equations. Suppose 
$v(x)$ is a solution to the second-order linear equation, 
$y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y=0.$ Substitute $y=v(x)w(x)$ in the equation and show 
you 
get a differential equation involving $w'$ and $w'',$ but not $w$ by 
itself. This new equation can be reduced to a first-order equation using 
the trick from problem 22 (but you just have to 
get the equation, not reduce the degree).<p /></li>

<li>For first-order equations we discovered that solution curves never 
cross. This was because if two solutions crossed, then we would have two 
different solutions to the corresponding initial value problem and that's 
not allowed by the existence and uniqueness theorem. We have a 
corresponding existence and uniqueness theorem for higher-order equations 
(which is given in the section on numerical methods for higher-order 
equations). 
However, solution curves for a higher-order equation may cross. Why 
doesn't this violate the existence and uniqueness theorem?

<hr>As derived in the text, underdamped free motion has the form
$$ \begin{align}
x(t)&=A\exp\left(-\frac{ct}{2m}\right)\cos(\omega_1t+\phi) \\
\omega_1&=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}-\left(\frac{c}{2m}\right)^2}.
\end{align} $$
This motion is <i>quasi-periodic</i>. That means 
the motion isn't periodic (since the amplitude is decaying) but the time 
between successive upcrossings (or downcrossings or maxima or minima) is 
constant (and, naturally, this time is called the <i>quasi-period</i>). It 
is straightforward to compute the spring constant of a 
spring. But 
computing the damping coefficient is difficult to do directly. A standard 
way to do so is to use the quasi-period. You'll work out the details of 
this below.

oscillation and time that it takes 4.2 seconds between upcrossings (i.e. 
the quasiperiod is 4.2 seconds). What 
are m, k, and c for the spring-mass system?
Use $g=980cm/sec^2$ for the acceleration of gravity.
<p /></li>

&nbsp;<p />
<li>If $m$ has units of $g,$ $k$ has units of $g/sec^2$ (or equivalently 
$ergs/cm$), and $c$ has units of $g/sec$ (or equivalently 
$ergs/(cm/sec)$), <ol type='a'>
<li>What are the units of (circular) quasi-frequency, $\omega_1,$ and</li>
<li>What are the units of quasi-period?</li>
</ol>
<p /></li>

<li>Show that increasing the damping of a spring-mass system increases the 
quasi-period.<p /></li>

<li>Suppose an undamped spring-mass system has a natural frequency of 2 
seconds. A damping mechanism is then attached to the system so that the 
damping constant can be set to any desired value. What are all 
the possible quasi-periods the system could have?<p /></li>
<hr />
The amplitude of an underdamped spring-mass system is
$\displaystyle A\exp\left(-\frac{ct}{2m}\right),$ which decays 
exponentially. So if you know the mass 
and the damping constant, you can determine decay rate. And if you know 
the mass and measure the decay rate, you can determine the damping 
constant. Note that measuring the decay of the amplitude is usually much 
more difficult in practice than measuring the quasi-period. The 
quasi-period can be determined by measuring the times between the system 
passing through the equilibrium position, which means you can set 
the measuring devices in a fixed position. Since the amplitude changes, 
the measuring devices will need to observe at different positions to 
measure the amplitude.
<p />
The <i>half-life</i> of the amplitude (or anything else that decays 
exponentially) is the time it takes for the amplitude to decrease to half 
its starting value. 
<hr />
<p />
<li>Suppose a spring-mass system has mass $500g$ and damping constant 
$750g/sec.$ What is the half-life of the amplitude of the system, i.e. how 
long does it take for the amplitude to be halved?<p /></li>
<li>Suppose a spring-mass system has mass $100g$ and damping constant 
$80g/sec.$ What is the half-life of the amplitude of the system, i.e. how 
long does it take for the amplitude to be halved?<p /></li>

<!--

half-life of 1 second, that is, the amplitude is cut in half every second.

&nbsp;<p />

<li>A spring-mass system has mass $350g$ and spring constant $700g/sec^2.$ 
The damping constant can be adjusted to take any value. What is the 
smallest half-life that can be obtained without the system becoming 
overdamped?<p /></li>

<li>A spring-mass system has mass $100g$ and spring constant $49g/sec^2.$ 
The damping constant can be adjusted to take any value. What is the 
smallest half-life that can be obtained without the system becoming 
overdamped?<p /></li>

<li>The extreme points (max and min) of underdamped free motion $x(t)$ 
occur when $x'(t)=0.$ Show that the timing of the extreme points is 
periodic. Note that you don't have to actually solve $x'(t)=0.$ You just 
have to show the solutions are periodic.<p /></li>

<li>Given that the extreme points occur at a set period from the previous 
problem, show that the ratio of the amplitudes of successive maxima is 
constant.<p /></li>

<li>You attach a mass to an <i>undamped</i> spring, which causes it to 
stretch $1.4cm.$ You then pull the mass down and release it (with initial 
velocity 0), starting the 
spring in motion. How long will it take the mass to return to the position 
from which it was released (to the nearest $0.1 sec$)? Yes you do have 
enough information to solve 
this problem. Use $g=980cm/sec^2$ for the acceleration of gravity.

<hr />
In designing systems to detect signals of various sorts, it is often 
useful to create a system that resonates at the frequency you wish to 
detect. This can happen with spring-mass systems used in seismographs or 
with LC circuits used in radio tuners. In the following problems you will 
need to remember that $\cos(at)$ has frequency $a/(2\pi)$ cycles per 
second. 
<hr />
<p />
<li>Consider an undamped spring-mass system with mass of $340g.$ What 
spring constant will cause it to resonate at a frequency of 6 cycles 
per second.
<p /></li>
<li>Consider an undamped spring-mass system with mass of $50kg.$ What 
spring constant will cause it to resonate at a frequency of 0.2 cycles 
per second.
<p /></li>
<li> If you have a coil of 70 millihenrys, what 
capacitance do you need to have the circuit resonate at 60Hz (60 cycles 
per second)? <p /></li>
<li> If you have a coil of 10 millihenrys, what 
capacitance do you need to have the circuit resonate at 1350kHz 
($1.35\times10^6$ cycles per second)? <p /></li>
&nbsp;<p />
<li>Show that for any unforced, overdamped system, there is 
<ol type='a'>
<li>a set of initial conditions such that the solution asymptotically 
approaches the equilibrium position (the origin), but never reaches it, 
and</li>
<li>a set of initial conditions such that the solution passes through the 
equilibrium position (the origin) exactly once, and then approaches the 
equilibrium position asymptotically as $t\to\infty.$</li>
</ol>
<p /></li>
<li>Show that if any solution to a spring-mass system (or LRC 
circuit) passes through the equilibrium position more 
than once, it is underdamped.<p /></li>
<hr />
As noted in the text, a forced undamped system can display the phenomenon 
of beats. The next few problems will go through the computations to 
explore this. 
<hr />
<p />
<li>The general solution to the forced undamped system 
$mx''+kx=F_0\cos(\omega t)$ 
is $\displaystyle x(t)=\frac{F_0}{m(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)}cos(\omega t) 
+ A\cos(\omega_0 t + \phi),$ where $\omega_0=\sqrt{k/m}$ and $A$ and 
$\phi$ are arbitrary constants. Show that with 
initial conditions $x(0)=0,$ $x'(0)=0,$ which correspond to starting the 
system from rest, the solution takes the form $x(t)=B(\cos(\omega t) - 
\cos(\omega_0 t))$ for some constant $B.$<p /></li>
<li>Use the identity 
$\displaystyle \cos(a)-\cos(b)=2\sin\left(\frac{a+b}2\right)
\sin\left(\frac{a-b}2\right),$ to rewrite the solution to the previous 
problem as a product of two sine waves.<p /></li>
<li>You can think of a function of the form $B\sin(at)\sin(rt)$ with $r$ 
much larger than $a$ as a "fast" sine curve $\sin(rt)$ 
with slowly varying amplitude $B\sin(at).$ Each of these frequencies can 
be measured. Suppose the amplitude is varying with frequency 
$\displaystyle \frac{1}{4\pi}$ cycles per second. How close is the 
circular frequency of the forcing function, $\omega$ to the natural 
frequency $\omega_0$?<p /></li>

Very old radio tuners often used an LC circuit (R=0) whose natural 
frequency could 
be adjusted to match the desired frequency of different broadcasts. Such a 
circuit would have a large response to the desired broadcast with a very 
small response to other broadcasts, enabling you to isolate one station 
out of all the different signals. Either the capacitance or the inductance 
could be made variable. 
If you had a fixed coil with a fixed value of L, 
then you would use a variable capacitor. Typically this was handled by 
having a set of fixed (stator) plates and a set of rotating (rotor) 
plates as illustrated. By turning the shaft, a different amount of area of 
the rotor plates would be opposite the stator plates, adjusting the 
capacitance. <b>In a circuit with a coil of inductance 10 millihenrys, 
what capacitance would you want to tune for a signal of 650kHz 
(6.5&times;10<sup>5</sup> cycles per second)?</b>
<p />
Note that starting shortly after World War I, tuners began using the 
superheterodyne system where a variable oscillator adds (heterodynes) an 
additional signal to shift the desired frequency to a standard frequency 
(455kHz for AM radio) and then the tuner can be fixed to detect just that 
frequency. This procedure still typically used variable capacitors in the 
oscillator.
